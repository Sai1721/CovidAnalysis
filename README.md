## **Project Overview**
COVID-19 Data Analysis with PySpark aims to provide insights into global pandemic trends by analyzing large-scale datasets. By leveraging PySpark's distributed computing capabilities, the project handles missing data, computes total cases per continent, and performs other transformations efficiently.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Framework**: Apache Spark (PySpark)  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## **Features**
- Data ingestion and preprocessing using PySpark.  
- Handling missing or invalid data efficiently.  
- Aggregation of total COVID-19 cases by continent.  
- Scalable solution for large datasets.  

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:
1. **Country**: Name of the country.  
2. **Continent**: Continent of the country.  
3. **Date**: Date of the data entry.  
4. **Total Cases**: Total confirmed cases of COVID-19.  
5. **Other Metrics**: Additional columns for analysis.

**Note**: Ensure that your dataset is clean and stored in a CSV format before running the analysis.

## **Setup and Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-pyspark-analysis.git
   cd covid19-pyspark-analysis
2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Ensure that Python and Apache Spark are installed on your system. You can install PySpark using:  
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**  
   Launch the Jupyter Notebook environment and open the provided notebook file.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   
## **Usage**

1. Place your dataset (CSV file) in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`covid_analysis.ipynb`) or the corresponding Python script.
3. Update the file path in the code to match your dataset.
4. Run the transformations and aggregations in the notebook to analyze the data.
5. View the computed results for insights into COVID-19 trends.

## **Results and Insights**

- **Data Cleaning:** Successfully handled missing or invalid entries.
- **Aggregated Results:** Total COVID-19 cases computed by continent.
- **Scalability:** Demonstrated the power of distributed computing for large datasets.
