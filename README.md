Project Overview
COVID-19 Data Analysis with PySpark aims to provide insights into global pandemic trends by analyzing large-scale datasets. By leveraging PySpark's distributed computing capabilities, the project handles missing data, computes total cases per continent, and performs other transformations efficiently.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x
Framework: Apache Spark (PySpark)
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Features
Data ingestion and preprocessing using PySpark.
Handling missing or invalid data efficiently.
Aggregation of total COVID-19 cases by continent.
Scalable solution for large datasets.
Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

Country: Name of the country.
Continent: Continent of the country.
Date: Date of the data entry.
Total Cases: Total confirmed cases of COVID-19.
Other Metrics: Additional columns for analysis.
Note: Ensure that your dataset is clean and stored in a CSV format before running the analysis.

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-pyspark-analysis.git
cd covid19-pyspark-analysis
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python and Apache Spark installed. Install Python dependencies using:
